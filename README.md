# Portfolio-building Exercises and the Capstone Project

## The 4 stages of your portfolio

Throughout the course you have been encouraged to develop your own unique portfolio that will allow you to showcase your skills to colleagues and future employers.

Developing your personal portfolio, your interests and skill set follows 4 stages. Each stage:

1. Builds on the skills gained in the previous stages, and
2. Becomes progressively more difficult and idividualized.

The 4 stages are

### Stage 1: EDA, Data Visualization and programming basics

Stage 1 occured with the Learning R and Learning Python modules, where you were tasked with working on a simple data set (i.e. `chickwts`, `diamonds`, etc.). 

The goal here is to showcase your technical skill (GitHub, R, Python, Command Line) and not your nascent analytical skills.

Thus, the data sets used here are very small, clean, easy-to-work-with and well-described.

### Stage 2: Developing a research question and analysis 

Stage 2 also occured in the Learning R and Learning Python modules, where you were also tasked with exploring a data set from Kaggle or Tidy Tuesday. These data sets are generally larger than what we used in the first stage. 

The goal here is to showcase your understanding of a reserach problem that a specific dataset can address. 

These data sets are generally very well described, which is a blessing and a curse. You have plenty of resources to review and learn from, but at the same time you need to try and produce something uniques. Your analysis should go beyond basic EDA and Data Visualization and try to address specific questions that the producer/holder of this data set would want to have answered.

### Stage 3: Machine Learning Discovery

Stage 3 occured in the Hands-on Machine Learning module. Throughout the three-week module you have been asked to apply your new knowledge in machine learning in two ways. Frist, the exercises ask you to work on provided  and well-described data sets. Second, and more importantly, you were tasked with seeking out a new data set to work on in more detail, applying specific machine learning methods where appropriate. 

These data sets are in general less popular, and thus more interesting in helping you to build your portfolio. Links to some resources can be found in the exercises in the Hand-on Machine Learning module.

The goal here is to showcase your comprehension of various machine learning methods, while at the same time further developing your data science skills. 

### Stage 4: The Capstone Project

Stage 4 is the Capstone Project, the largest and most time-intensive part of your portfolio. In the last two weeks of the course, you will have time to work on and, in the last days, to present this project.

The Capstone Project is a self-guided research project, each student should have their own project. 

In this stage, you may apply all the material covered in the course, but you can also venture beyond. e.g. you may decide to:

- Develop a reproducible analytical workflow for a specific type of data that you feel is not well-serviced by existing packages in R or Python.
- Create an R or Python package that can be distributed to your colleagues that can be used to address a specific set of analytical problems.
- Explore text using Natural Language Processing (NLP). This module is available but will not be part of the core course.
- Develop an interactive web-interface to a specific workflow, for training, exploring or reporting results. A short module is available in R for this.
- Explore a specific algorithim in Data Science that we have not covered in the course by applying it to different data sets and describing e.g. its assumptions, uses, interpretation and limitations.

These are just some ideas -- Data Science is a vast topic, and we are just scratching the surface of the most useful tools in this course. You may decide to go deeper into topics that are not incluced in this course, such as time series forcasting, geospatial data or financial data. 

Please reach out to your Instructor and Teaching Assisstant for more advice!

### Obtaining data for your Capstone Project

We are at the half-way point of the course, so you should begin thinking about what you want to explore for your Capstone Project now.

It can take several weeks to obtain the data or settle on an appropriate topic. If you are currently working and can obtain propietary data from your employeers, this can be incredible beneficial. It will be unique, and hopefully you can actually use the results of your analysis! If you don't have access to propietary data, then ideally, you would work on a data set that has not been well-described. It can be a public data set, but you should put in the effort to work with it in a way that has not already been done. 

## Additional Details

As the course progresses and we encounter recurring issues with working on the Capstone Project, we'll update this repository with tips to help you along.
